To transmit their messages securely, Alice and Bob use a secret key, that is known only to the two of them, and not to Eve.These are called private-key cryptosystems. We do not yet care how this key is established in the first place, as it would have required some secure communication. We focus on this later sessionsSuch an encryption scheme consists of two processes, The encoding of the message given the key by applying the encoding function, This is done by Alice. Note that is called the plain-text and is called the cipher-text.\nThe decoding of the encrypted message given the key by applying the decoding function, This is done by Bob.\nObviously, we want such a scheme to give us the correct message after decoding. Therefore, we demand,Such a scheme of encoding is called correct! It is easy to come up with an example of such a scheme, for example let , that is send the message as it is.But as you realise, sending the message as it is is as insecure as it gets. So, we need a notion of security. Security of a private-key scheme\nA encryption/decryption scheme is called secure if for all prior distributions over the messages, where For example, if Alice would be equally likely to send any out of messages to Bob, even after reading the encrypted message, Eve cannot guess the message better than with a probability of . It is easy to come up with an example of such a secure scheme as well, we can just ignore the message and send randomly any cipher-text , for example by flipping a coin and sending or . Goal\nTo design a scheme that is both correct and secure\nBoth the trivial schemes we designed didn't even use a key. How necessary is a key? Shannon Secrecy Condition\nAn encryption scheme can be both secure and correct if the number of possible keys is at least as large as number of possible messages. Proof Let . Let be the cipher-text that corresponds to some message and , i.e . This is intercepted by Eve.\nEve computes\nThis is the set of messages such that there is a key that maps them to the cipher-text . Clearly, .\nAlso . So there exists a message such that , i.e\nWe can assume that all messages have . Hence breaks the secrecy\nTo illustrate the proof, let us look at an encoding/decoding scheme. Let Alice send two bit messages, , , , by using a key of size , by flipping the first bit if and leaving it as it is otherwise. Let's say Alice send the message and with , without having any access to the cipher-text Eve's guess is correct only with probability. But after obtaining the cipher-text , Eve can compute the space of possibility for the message, i.e and , which implies that Eve can guess the plain-text with the probability . This implies that the scheme is not secure. So can we come up with a scheme that is both secure and correct with ? Info\nAlice and Bob following encoding/decoding scheme, It is easy to check that this scheme is correct, i.e for any , we have We prove that is is also secure. Note that the security of a scheme highly depends on the knowledge of the eavesdropper about the secret key, encoded in the distribution . Here, a critical assumption that we make is that in Eve's perspective, all keys are equally likely, i.e . And let's assume there is some prior distribution over the messages, . Note that this may or may not be uniform. The goal is to show that for all , Proof Therefore this scheme has no extra \"information\" in the cipher-text given no-knowledge of the key. How can this be extended to a quantum bit? How to hide the quantum information from an eavesdropper? Let's say Alice sends a quantum state to Bob, and this is intercepted by Eve. How can we encode the state to ensure that Eve doesn't gain any access to the information? General Scheme\nEncoding by Alice Decoding by Bob Again, we need to provide the definition of correctness and security of this scheme. The scheme is correct if The scheme is secure if Let us design a one time pad for qubits, with a key size of by adopting the bit flip approach. Then, for , we have, This is a correct scheme! But is it secure? Although for this works, it fails for , as you get We use bits to encode one qubit, Clearly the scheme is correct. But is it secure? Yes, by the following lemma Lemma This can be generalised to encoding qubits, by using bits. Can you write the encoding operation? In this section, we want to understand the privacy of the secret key that we use for the other cryptographic protocols. Let's say Alice owns a classical register with the key of size written. Eve can hold the following joint quantum state with the register. These are known as classical-quantum states. Ideally, we want this state to be of the form such that Eve can gain no information about the key that Alice and Bob possess. This condition means that Eve is ignorant of the key. To start with assume that the state of Alice and Eve is uncorrelated, but Alice (from the perspective of Eve!) has a state where is not a uniform distribution. One might be tempted to measure the uncertainty of the obtained key in terms of the Shannon Entropy of , as obviously this is maximised if and only if Alice's state is uniform. Let's assume that that the key is guaranteed to have an entropy of , and we wish to perform the one-time pad with this key. Is this good?Info\nWe can check that the following distribution, has the But this means that if Eve guesses the key to , she is right about percent of the time, and also decrypt the message with probability . So overall, even though the Shannon Entropy might be very high, the protocol is not cryptographically that secure. We need a better measure for uncertainty.Min-Entropy Calculating the minimum entropy for the previous distribution, we get for all sizes of the key, Effectively, the min entropy measures what Eve can do with the best guess of the key which is exactly as compared to Shannon entropy that measures what Eve can do with the average guess We have the following inequalities,\nGiven a classical quantum state, we want to define a quantity that captures the information Eve can gain about the classical register from her part of the correlated quantum state . Conditional Mutual Information (for CQ states) For a classical quantum state , Eve has all the information about the key. Therefore, we get choosing . For the uncorrelated state , we obtain\nMoreover, we obtain this equal to for the following choice of POVMsuch that Therefore, we get .The final goal for today is to understand general \"quantum\" conditional min entropy. How can a quantum system gain maximum side information about another system? If it is completely correlated with the other system. In quantum mechanics, a stronger form of correlation also exists in form of the maximally entangled state. It is a quantum state that is \"correlated\" in all basis. We use this to define the conditional min-entropy for general quantum states. Intuitively, to be the adversary, we want to do the best quantum operation on Eve's end to gain maximum correlation with the \"key\" system, possibly in all basis!Conditional min-entropy (for general quantum states)\nwhere and This is equivalent to the following definition, The proof of this equivalence will be shown in the next session. Right now, we look at the following exercise.
