Doing so will yield a somewhat "fairly" secret key.Info
This key will only be fairly secret, as other individuals might also know such shared information, and Eve might be able to gather some through various means.
Naturally, Alice and Bob want to find a scheme to create an actually secret key from this fairly secret starting key.Introducing privacy amplification :Alice and Bob share a "weak secret" which comes from some distribution , represented as a random variable called the source.
While the distribution of may not be known, is available to both parties.Eve possesses side information which might be correlated to , such as its first bit, its parity, or even some quantum state .The goal for Alice and Bob is to generate some such that from the point of view of Eve, (chosen from a distribution ) is (close to) uniformally random.Note
The size of will depend on how secret the original secret is. If there is not much that can be done.
Intuitively, this will be quantified by the min-entropy .
Let's first start with a simpler problem, Alice has some source from which she gathers a string , which is possibly correlated with , with the promise that (with this condition, is called a -source), and is tasked to generate such that the distribution is close to uniform even conditionned on . Similar setup as before, but Alice is on her own and does not have to coordinate with bob.Note
While Alice could just sample from an actually uniform distribution, or measure in the Hadamard basis a bunch of times, assume here that randomness is costly, and Alice does not have ready access to large amounts of randomness for free. The goal is to extract randomness from X.
If has a distribution consisting of i.i.d. variables , one can extract a single bit nearly uniformly by taking the parity of all the bitsExample i.i.d., take .
If has probability 3/4 of being 1, 1/4 of being 0, for we have , . Not quite uniform, but better than what we started with, and better still for increasing .
One can use the same approach for variables which aren't identically distributed, and get a single bit close to a uniform distribution. However this is not very efficient.Using a deterministic function to extract randomness (such as ) can only get you so far however, since for any , even if , there is no function that can always extract bits of randomness from .Instead, we need to expand the scope to seeded extractor functions, which use a seed as a source of randomness. However, since this randomness may be costly, the seed should be of relatively small size compared to and .Definition
A weak seeded extractor is a function Ext : such that for any -source ,
With uniformally distributed, independent from and .
One might think that one could simply use the seed as randomness, but Alice and Bob could not choose the same seed as a private key without communicating it publicly.This induces the definition for a strong seeded extractor, where the extractor's input is independent from the seedDefinition
A strong seeded extractor is a function Ext : such that for any -source ,
With uniformally distributed, independent from and .
Intuitively, the min-entropy gives an estimate of how much randomness there is to extract from , but it is a valid question to seek if a strong seeded extractor really can extract bits from if it has (meaning it is a -source).If , it is impossible to extract more than bits from while still being uncorrelated to , because you can guess the value of the extractor function by guessing first then applying the function, so , in particular .Conversely, we will show strong seeded extractors which achieve the extraction of a (mostly) uniform bits given being a -source.To build a strong seeded extractor, we will make use of hashing functions, which essentially take a long string and map them to shorter strings somewhat uniformally.We need to introduce classes of hashing functions families, namely 1-universal and 2-universal hash function families :1-universal family
A family of hashing functions , is 1-universal if for every and , Notice that the definition has and fixed, and the probability is over the family of functions.While a 1-universal family is enough to build a weak extractor, the following definition will let us build a strong one :2-universal family
A family of hashing functions , is 1-universal if for every and , Once given such a family, the extractor will use the seed to choose a function in the family, and apply it to to obtain . While the set of all functions is a 2-universal family, it has too many functions, and the seed would need to be too large to be practical.Instead, we will take functions in the field with elements, of the form where multiplication and addition are done in . This yields a family of functions which so happens to be a 2-universal family of hashing functions.Proof
Let , the probability of is the probability of , so and . This gives us a single possible choice for and , among , giving us the correct probability.
Notice how the functions map bit strings to bit strings, but we can simply toss the extra bits we don't want such that we are given bit strings, which still retains the 2-universality property.Our extractor will now be defined as To analyze the quality of the hashing functions, we will make use of the leftover hash lemma, which has different formulations depending on whether we consider quantum side information or not.In this case, we don't take into account from Eve, in which case the lemma is stated as follows:Lemma
Let integers, , , and a 2-universal family of hash functions. Then is a strong seeded extractor.
With our construction, the seed needs to be of length to be able to choose the hashing function, which is longer than the optimal seed length for the general case, but in the case of privacy amplification it is satisfactory. In the case without side information, we have .To prove this lemma, we will proceed in two steps. First we want to show that the error can be bounded by first showing a bound on the collision probability, and then we bound this collision probability and achieve the result of the bound on the error.As mentionned, we want to bound the error by something related to the collision probability where , and First part of the proof Using Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, After expanding the square and doing much simplification, Here we make use of the 2-universal family property to bound the collision probability .Second part of the proof
By expanding the square in the definition, we have
Using 2-universality,
Using the property of the minimal entropy being bounded by ,
Plugging this back into the first part we get that the error is bounded by proving the lemma.
To model side information, we will take to be a cq-state such that .Before proving the statement with side information, we need to dive into the measurements Eve can make. Indeed, finding the optimal measurement to guess can be solved via semi-definite programming, but there is no formula whenever . Instead, we will have to consider pretty good measurements.Choosing the measurement is positive semidefinite, but not necessarily normalized such that , except when the are perfectly distinguishable. We can instead define where and we use the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, and is a POVM. One can show that the probability of guessing using and this POVM is the square of the optimal probability given any POVM.The proof with this pretty good measurement of the quality of our strong seeded extractor follows the same structure as the previous one, however it is quite more involved. If you do want to check it out, it starts page 13 of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ocw.tudelft.nl/wp-content/uploads/LN_Week4.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://ocw.tudelft.nl/wp-content/uploads/LN_Week4.pdf" target="_self">Lecture 4</a>.Using the results we have just shown, we can now devise a relatively simple protocol for privacy amplification:Privacy Amplification Protocol Alice and Bob build their shared weak secret , which might be correlated to Eve's .
Alice chooses a random seed for the extractor, and sends it to Bob through the public channel.
Alice and Bob each compute using the extractor built with hashing functions over the finite field with elements. This protocol is always correct since Alice and Bob perform the same computation (assuming they have the correct shared to start with).It is also secure, as our seeded extractor gives us the guarantee that is close to uniform, even conditionned on and . By using the 2-universal family of hash functions to build the strong seeded extractor, the protocol is now complete.This will be useful for next session, which will discuss key distribution protocols.]]></description><link>quantum-crypto/session-2-improving-security.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Quantum Crypto/Session 2 - Improving Security.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 12:44:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Quantum Cryptography Workgroup]]></title><description><![CDATA[

To transmit their messages securely, Alice and Bob use a secret key, that is known only to the two of them, and not to Eve.These are called private-key cryptosystems. We do not yet care how this key is established in the first place, as it would have required some secure communication. We focus on this later sessionsSuch an encryption scheme consists of two processes, The encoding of the message given the key by applying the encoding function, This is done by Alice. Note that is called the plain-text and is called the cipher-text.
The decoding of the encrypted message given the key by applying the decoding function, This is done by Bob.
Obviously, we want such a scheme to give us the correct message after decoding. Therefore, we demand,Such a scheme of encoding is called correct! It is easy to come up with an example of such a scheme, for example let , that is send the message as it is.But as you realise, sending the message as it is is as insecure as it gets. So, we need a notion of security. Security of a private-key scheme
A encryption/decryption scheme is called secure if for all prior distributions over the messages, where For example, if Alice would be equally likely to send any out of messages to Bob, even after reading the encrypted message, Eve cannot guess the message better than with a probability of . It is easy to come up with an example of such a secure scheme as well, we can just ignore the message and send randomly any cipher-text , for example by flipping a coin and sending or . Goal
To design a scheme that is both correct and secure
Both the trivial schemes we designed didn't even use a key. How necessary is a key? Shannon Secrecy Condition
An encryption scheme can be both secure and correct if the number of possible keys is at least as large as number of possible messages. Proof Let . Let be the cipher-text that corresponds to some message and , i.e . This is intercepted by Eve.
Eve computes
This is the set of messages such that there is a key that maps them to the cipher-text . Clearly, .
Also . So there exists a message such that , i.e
We can assume that all messages have . Hence breaks the secrecy
To illustrate the proof, let us look at an encoding/decoding scheme. Let Alice send two bit messages, , , , by using a key of size , by flipping the first bit if and leaving it as it is otherwise. Let's say Alice send the message and with , without having any access to the cipher-text Eve's guess is correct only with probability. But after obtaining the cipher-text , Eve can compute the space of possibility for the message, i.e and , which implies that Eve can guess the plain-text with the probability . This implies that the scheme is not secure. So can we come up with a scheme that is both secure and correct with ? Info
Alice and Bob following encoding/decoding scheme, It is easy to check that this scheme is correct, i.e for any , we have We prove that is is also secure. Note that the security of a scheme highly depends on the knowledge of the eavesdropper about the secret key, encoded in the distribution . Here, a critical assumption that we make is that in Eve's perspective, all keys are equally likely, i.e . And let's assume there is some prior distribution over the messages, . Note that this may or may not be uniform. The goal is to show that for all , Proof Therefore this scheme has no extra "information" in the cipher-text given no-knowledge of the key. How can this be extended to a quantum bit? How to hide the quantum information from an eavesdropper? Let's say Alice sends a quantum state to Bob, and this is intercepted by Eve. How can we encode the state to ensure that Eve doesn't gain any access to the information? General Scheme
Encoding by Alice Decoding by Bob Again, we need to provide the definition of correctness and security of this scheme. The scheme is correct if The scheme is secure if Let us design a one time pad for qubits, with a key size of by adopting the bit flip approach. Then, for , we have, This is a correct scheme! But is it secure? Although for this works, it fails for , as you get We use bits to encode one qubit, Clearly the scheme is correct. But is it secure? Yes, by the following lemma Lemma This can be generalised to encoding qubits, by using bits. Can you write the encoding operation? In this section, we want to understand the privacy of the secret key that we use for the other cryptographic protocols. Let's say Alice owns a classical register with the key of size written. Eve can hold the following joint quantum state with the register. These are known as classical-quantum states. Ideally, we want this state to be of the form such that Eve can gain no information about the key that Alice and Bob possess. This condition means that Eve is ignorant of the key. To start with assume that the state of Alice and Eve is uncorrelated, but Alice (from the perspective of Eve!) has a state where is not a uniform distribution. One might be tempted to measure the uncertainty of the obtained key in terms of the Shannon Entropy of , as obviously this is maximised if and only if Alice's state is uniform. Let's assume that that the key is guaranteed to have an entropy of , and we wish to perform the one-time pad with this key. Is this good?Info
We can check that the following distribution, has the But this means that if Eve guesses the key to , she is right about percent of the time, and also decrypt the message with probability . So overall, even though the Shannon Entropy might be very high, the protocol is not cryptographically that secure. We need a better measure for uncertainty.Min-Entropy Calculating the minimum entropy for the previous distribution, we get for all sizes of the key, Effectively, the min entropy measures what Eve can do with the best guess of the key which is exactly as compared to Shannon entropy that measures what Eve can do with the average guess We have the following inequalities,
Given a classical quantum state, we want to define a quantity that captures the information Eve can gain about the classical register from her part of the correlated quantum state . Conditional Mutual Information (for CQ states) For a classical quantum state , Eve has all the information about the key. Therefore, we get choosing . For the uncorrelated state , we obtain
Moreover, we obtain this equal to for the following choice of POVMsuch that Therefore, we get .The final goal for today is to understand general "quantum" conditional min entropy. How can a quantum system gain maximum side information about another system? If it is completely correlated with the other system. In quantum mechanics, a stronger form of correlation also exists in form of the maximally entangled state. It is a quantum state that is "correlated" in all basis. We use this to define the conditional min-entropy for general quantum states. Intuitively, to be the adversary, we want to do the best quantum operation on Eve's end to gain maximum correlation with the "key" system, possibly in all basis!Conditional min-entropy (for general quantum states)
where and This is equivalent to the following definition, The proof of this equivalence will be shown in the next session. Right now, we look at the following exercise.
